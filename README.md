# Bustle Mock

This one-day project is designed to look like the news site bustle and was done to practice use of the Ember.js framework. Users can see a list of article preview titles, click on an article to be taken to its page, and use the navbar to navigate. An 'admin' can create, update, and delete articles (no authentication in place at this time).

This app uses the Firebase.io database.
