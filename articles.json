    "body": "The Internet has its moments. Sometimes it provides us with things as magnificent as Grumpy Cat and the 'Why You Lyin'' meme, and it can also bring us together as a global community to support total strangers in need. It's such a great communication tool, but unfortunately, sometimes it's used for evil. At the moment, perhaps no one knows that dark side of the Internet better than Legends of Tomorrow star Wentworth Miller, who was on the receiving end of a degrading meme. But, like a superhero himself, he used his power of fame for good and fought against it."
